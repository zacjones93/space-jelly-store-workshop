# Lesson 00: Introduction

Ecommerce is an exiciting example of the cool things we can build for the web. It's also a way for us to express our ideas, and even make a little money on the side, by selling our work to the world.

What do we need to get started?

## Getting Started
Before we dive into our first lesson, we'll walk through the basics and what to expect from this workshop.

### 1. Welcome and where to get started

Thanks for joining along with this workshop! Whether you're trying to sell something or trying to buy something, ecommerce is an important part of how the world operates. I'm looking forward to taking you through the journey of setting up your own online store to sell your products to the world.

### 2. What to expect from this workshop

Ecommerce places a large role in our day to day lives from buying something silly on Amazon to ordering a prescription that can help you survive. This makes the decisions we make for how we build an app and what kind of experience we provide important.

In this workshop, we'll get started by creating a new app. We'll use Next.js, a React-based web framework, to spin up a new project from scratch that we'll use to create our online store.

Once we have our store ready to go, we'll start adding products that we'll eventually sell to our customers. We'll learn how to manage these products dynamically in a separate file and use those products to build a UI including a homepage with all of our products, a page for each of our products, and a shopping cart page that our customers can use to manage their products.

Through this process, we'll learn core React concepts including how we can use the useState hook to manage app state, what the React Context API is and how we can incorporate it to add a global cart state to our app, and how can we package this all in a custom hook to use anywhere in our app.

The purchasing experience will be integrated with Stripe Checkout, a leading ecommerce provider, that will allow us to set up a checkout flow. We'll wrap in Stripe's API into our Next.js app to provide a personalized experience where our customers can purchase our goods.

## Extra Credit

For our first set of Extra Credit, we'll take some time to look through some articles that provide some context around what ecommerce is and what kinds of challenges we face when building ecommerce apps in React.

### 1. E-Commerce for React Developers

Ecommerce is a crazy, dynamic world. The experience we need to provide to our customers needs to be personalized from showing up-to-date product information and providing a shopping cart they can use to purchase those products.

In this article, I talk about the challenges of ecommerce and how we can leverage React to solve them.

*Note: this also includes a tutorial, which you can skip if you're following along with the workshop.*
